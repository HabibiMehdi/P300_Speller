# P300_Speller
Welcome to the P300 Speller BCI project repository! This project aims to implement a P300 Speller for Brain-Computer Interface applications, inspired by the BCI Competition. The P300 Speller is a system that utilizes EEG signals to allow users to spell out words or commands by focusing their attention on specific characters presented in a matrix.
